**Things not to miss**

- The beautiful email sent by Plates to all of your friends for every link
  shared on a plate. Your friends can even reply to the email and it'll show up
  in your email inbox.
- Private data. All of the data is locked down to the members of a plate. Try
  opening a link in different browser.
- Real time everywhere. New plate invite? It'll show up instantly. Wonder if a
  friend has viewed at a link? Read status updates instantly, from any page
  of the app.
- Real time comments. It's a chat room for every link you share.
- Share a direct link to a gif? It'll animate _in the email_.
- Mozilla Persona is fabulous. Easily switch between many email accounts and
  sets of plates by signing in and out _without a page refresh_.
- Responsive design. We've been using it on our iPhones and loving it.
